## About Me

👨‍💻 I'm a software developer, currently working on the LLVM RISC-V target.

👨‍🏫 I used to be a programming languages researcher. I worked on Checked C and Idris, as well as other projects and [publications](https://lenary.co.uk/publications/). Even longer ago I worked on designing CRDTs.
